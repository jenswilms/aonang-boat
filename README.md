## Aonang boat service

I was on a holiday in Krabi, Thailand. What's special about Krabi is all the neighbouring islands that can only be reached by boat. In Krabi, you have one boat service: you have to go to the service desk, say where you want to go and wait until a minimum amount of people show up. After 2 days of long waiting (especially since I was traveling alone), I got fed up with the inefficiency and spent about a day locked up in my hotel room to build a software for them; people could sign up their prefered destination and time and find other popular times.

The goal of the website is to reduce the irritation of endless waiting: people can select their trip more efficient and won't have to spend too much time waiting in Ao Nang.

Simple website, connected with Firebase as a back-end.
User can:

- See in a timetable when other people want to go based on different destinations
- Let others know when they want to use the boatservice
- See basic information about boat service

Made use of the package: "react-timecalendar". However, package was not compitable with current react version. Copied the package and modified it locally in "timecalendar" folder.
